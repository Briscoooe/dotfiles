# Community contributed blocklets

This repository contains a set of scripts (a.k.a. *blocklets*) for 
[i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks), contributed by the 
community.

It is officially maintained by a bench of active i3blocks crafters.

Each release of this repository will be guaranteed to work against 
a given [release](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks/releases) of 
i3blocks (a.k.a. *core*).

You may want to take a look at the individual blocklet directories,
which contain descriptions, screenshots, and installation/configuration 
instructions.
Note: configurations reference `$SCRIPT_DIR`, meaning the directory that you put
the script into. 
You must change `$SCRIPT_DIR` appropriately to coincide with where you put
your scripts, for more info see the [FAQ](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks-contrib/wiki/FAQ#blocklets-refer-to-script_dir-what-does-that-mean-how-can-i-use-it).
